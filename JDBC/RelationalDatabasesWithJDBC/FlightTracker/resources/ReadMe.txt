The Outage

At about 2:30 a.m., all the check-in kiosks went red on the monitoring console. 
Every single one, everywhere in the country, stopped servicing requests at the same time. 
A few minutes later, the IVR servers went red too. 
Not exactly panic time, but pretty close, because 2:30 a.m. Pacific time is 5:30 a.m. Eastern time, 
which is prime time for commuter flight check-in on the Eastern seaboard. 
The operations center immediately opened a Severity 1 case and got the local team on a conference call.


Consequences
Three hours might not sound like much, especially when you compare that to some legendary outages. 
(British Airways’ global outage from June 2017—blamed on a power supply failure—comes to mind, for example.) 
The impact to the airline lasted a lot longer than just three hours, though. 
Airlines don’t staff enough gate agents to check everyone in using the old systems. 
When the kiosks go down, the airline has to call in agents who are off shift. 
Some of them are over their 40 hours for the week, incurring union-contract overtime (time and a half). 
Even the off-shift agents are only human, though. 
By the time the airline could get more staff on-site, they could deal only with the backlog. 
That took until nearly 3 p.m.

It took so long to check in the early-morning flights that planes could not push back from their gates. 
They would’ve been half-empty. 
Many travelers were late departing or arriving that day. 
Thursday happens to be the day that a lot of “nerd-birds” fly: commuter flights returning consultants to their home cities. 
Since the gates were still occupied, incoming flights had to be switched to other unoccupied gates.
 So even travelers who were already checked in still were inconvenienced and had to rush from their original gate to the reallocated gate.
