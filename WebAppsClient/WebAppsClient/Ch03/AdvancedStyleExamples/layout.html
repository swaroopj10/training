        <h2>Galway Bay</h2>
        <div>
            If you ever go across the sea to Ireland,<br />
            Then maybe at the closing of the day,<br />
            You can sit and watch the moon rise over <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Claddagh,+Galway,+Ireland/">Claddagh</a>,<br />
            And watch the sun go down on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway_Bay">Galway Bay</a></a>.<br />
            <br />
            Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream,<br />
            The women in the meadow making hay,<br />
            Just to sit beside the turf fire in a cabin,<br />
            And watch the barefoot <span class="tooltip">gossoons<span class="tooltiptext">noun Irish English: a boy;
                    lad (from Irish gars√∫n)</span></span> as they play.<br />
            <br />
            For the breezes blowing o'er the seas from Ireland,<br />
            Are perfumed by the heather as they blow,<br />
            And the women in the uplands digging <span class="tooltip">praties<span class="tooltiptext">noun Scottish,
                    Northern England, Irish and Eastern Canada informal: a potato</span></span>,<br />
            Speak a language that the strangers do not know.<br />
            <br />
            Yet the strangers came and tried to teach us their ways,<br />
            And they scorned us just for being what we are,<br />
            But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams,<br />
            Or light a penny candle from a star.<br />
            <br />
            And if there is to be a life hereafter,<br />
            And somehow I am sure there's going to be,<br />
            I will ask my God to let me make my Heaven,<br />
            In that dear land across the Irish sea.<br />
